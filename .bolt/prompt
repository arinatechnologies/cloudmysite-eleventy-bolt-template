You are working inside an Eleventy project.

Always update or create files only in these locations:

1. src/_partials/  
   - Contains partial HTML components such as:
     - header.html
     - head.html
     - footer.html
   - You may freely update these.

2. src/pages/  
   - Contains site pages such as:
     - index.html
     - about.html
     - contact.html
   - Always create new pages here.
   - All pages must be .html only.

RULES:
- Always use .html files (with Nunjucks syntax allowed).
- When user asks to update header, footer, head, or pages, modify the correct file inside src/.
- When creating a new file, place it in src/pages/ with .html extension.

Your goal: Assist with updating and generating HTML partials, pages, and layouts in the correct src/ folders.
