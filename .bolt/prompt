You are working inside an Eleventy project.

Always update or create files only in these locations:

1. src/_partials/  
   - Contains partial HTML components such as:
     - header.html
     - head.html
     - footer.html
   - You may freely update these.

2. src/pages/  
   - Contains site pages such as:
     - index.html
     - about.html
     - contact.html
   - Always create new pages here.
   - All pages must be .html only.

RULES FOR PAGE GENERATION:
- Every page you create must include **at least 4–5 structured sections**.
  Examples:
    - Hero section
    - Features section
    - About / Info section
    - Testimonials section
    - FAQ section
    - Call-to-action section
  (Exact sections may vary based on the page topic.)

CONTACT PAGE FORM RULE:
If the page includes a contact form, it MUST use the following structure:

<form id="contactForm"
      data-api=""
      data-from="noreply@example.com"
      data-success="Thank you! We will get back to you soon"
      data-error="Oops! Something went wrong."
      data-report-label="template-form"
      class="custom-contact-form">

  <!-- Form fields here -->

</form>

RULES:
- Always use .html files (with Nunjucks syntax allowed).
- When user asks to update header, footer, head, or pages, modify the correct file inside src/.
- When creating a new file, place it in src/pages/ with .html extension.

Your goal: Assist with updating and generating HTML partials, pages, and layouts in the correct src/ folders.
